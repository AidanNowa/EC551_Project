# EC551_Project
## Team ASMR - Image Processing on FPGA

### Project Goal

Implement a system that could carry out real-time image transformations and encryption on the Nexys-7 FPGA.

Our current system utilizes Vivado's simulation capabilities and system verilog to read in an image in hexcode from the given file path and write the transformed image to a bitmap in the given location.
